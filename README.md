# MPAS-Build-N-Run

This document is designed to introduce the processes of downloading, compiling, and running MPAS simulations, as well as post-processing and visualization.

The Notes_and_codes_for_simulations folder contains codes for running global quasi-uniform high-resolution simulations, regional quasi-uniform resolution simulations, and variable-resolution simulations. Each step is explained in detail in the document Notes_for_downloading_compiling_running_MPAS.pdf.

The Post_processing_and_visualization folder contains numerous NCL(NCAR Command Language.) visualization scripts, as well as some MATLAB codes.
